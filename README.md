Hi there!


The bookini app was made during the Ironhack Web Developer bootcamp.

In this app we build an app with react from 0. We build the app using creat react app start from there.


The purpose it was to build an app where we could reinforce our react, css and js tech skills.
We created an app with an API integration (GoodReads) where you can find a curated selection off books and booksellers.

If you would like to test it, don't forget to npm install to have all the packages installed and use the backend (express.js) - https://github.com/Joaouva/bookini-server



FEATURES:
- GoodReads API Connection
- Log in using google
- backend integration
- Profile page
- Books by user page
- Cart integration for e-commerce purpose


Fell free to test and give feedback :)
